_Feature and capabilities of the project:
+In the main activity I create the listview to display five books I updated in the app. When uesrs click any books of the listview it will move to the book activity and then it wil appear five buttons have the name of each book and users click any name of the book they want to read to move to the detail activity to read the contents of the book

+I created the menu activity. There are 4 button: open book page, open location page, music control, music pause.

In the first button to move from the menu to the book page to see the listview  of the books I updated on the app

In the second button to move to the location page to allow users use gps fuction to search my location and know the  distance of the location.

In the third button to play the background music . I created this function to allow users can listening the music during they  are reading books on my app.

In the fourth button to pause the background music if they donâ€™t want listen it anymore.

+I already insert pictures  in image view of almost activities of my app to make it  is excited
